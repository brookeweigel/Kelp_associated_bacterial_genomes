# **The final MAG database files generated in anvio (contigs.db, profile.db) are available on the FigShare repository here:**
# https://figshare.com/s/84c036dc253a5dd1b1b9
### Note: the files are too large to upload to GitHub


### The file "gtdbtk.bac120.user_msa.fasta.treefile" contains a phylogeny of all non-redundant MAGs in this study

### The files misc-data-taxonomy.txt, misc_table_carbon.txt, misc_table_nitrogen.txt were provided as additional layers to generate the final figures in anvio
### See code "2_Post-assembly MAG analyses" for details about how to visualize final graphs using these files.
